# Airbnb Clone Project

## Overview
The Airbnb Clone Project is a web application designed to mimic the core functionalities of Airbnb, enabling users to browse, book, and manage accommodations online. This project aims to provide a seamless and user-friendly platform for both hosts and guests, facilitating easy listing of properties and hassle-free booking experiences.

## Project Goals
- Build a fully functional accommodation booking platform similar to Airbnb.
- Implement user authentication and profiles for hosts and guests.
- Enable hosts to create, update, and manage property listings.
- Allow guests to search for listings based on location, date, and other filters.
- Support booking management, including reservation creation and cancellation.
- Provide a clean, intuitive user interface with responsive design.
- Ensure secure handling of user data and transactions.


## Technology Stack

- **Python**: The primary programming language used to build the backend of the application, chosen for its simplicity and powerful libraries.

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It handles URL routing, database interaction, templating, and user authentication for the project.

- **Django REST Framework (DRF)**: A powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs in Django. It facilitates creating RESTful endpoints to support frontend-backend communication.

- **djangorestframework-simplejwt**: A JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication plugin for Django REST Framework. It provides secure, stateless authentication for the API, managing user tokens for login sessions.

- **SQLite**: The default lightweight relational database used during development for storing user data, property listings, and bookings. Can be replaced with more robust databases like PostgreSQL for production.

- **HTML & CSS**: Markup and styling languages used to create the structure and design of the frontend pages.

- **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to the frontend components, enhancing user experience.
